**MWL `twister3`** 

Code and hardware designs for the MWL `twister3`, a simple and fast
stepper-based tetrode twister. `twister3`'s design was inspired by the
[SpikeGadgets Tetrode Fabrication
Machine](http://www.spikegadgets.com/hardware/tetmachine.html).

** This manual is a work in progress. PRs welcome. **

# Usage

### Using the controller

![Twister3 control box.](./resources/control-box/control-box-usage.png)

Using the `twister3` controller is simple. Just follow these steps:

* Power the device using a 12VDC, center-postive source.
* Place your finger on the control knob. This is the device's only user input
  mechanism.
    * __Pressing it__ will cycle through different settings (forward turns,
      backward turns, turn speed, turning mode)
    * __Turning it__ will increment or decrement the selected setting depending
      on turn direction.
    * __Pressing and holding it__ for 500 msec will execute the twist sequence
      using the current settings
    * __Pressing it__ during a twist will cancel the twist and stop the motor
      immediately.

The motor on `twister3` serves two purposes:

1. Twisting tetrodes (Mode 0)
1. Loading bobbins with tetrode wires (Mode 1)

The mode can be selected using the dial on the `twister3` controller. 
After a mode is selected, all turning parameters pertain to that mode only.
Using `twister3` for each of these purposes is detailed below.

## Twisting Tetrodes
![Making a tetrode.](./resources/operation/make-tetrode.png){width=80%}
\FloatBarrier

To make a tetrode, follow these steps: 

1. Pull down the wire from all 4 of the bobbins and group with your fingers
2. Clamp the bundle with the alligator clip
3. Pull the twisting attachment's leaf spring up until under slight tension, about 1 cm.
4. Move the alligator clip down to meet the magnet on the twisting attachment.
Now, the leaf spring should be in opposition with the upward force produced by
the tetrode wire. Each of the wires should be pulled straight.
5. Make sure the controller is in `mode 0` and has been set to the desired amount of turns and turn speed.
6. Hold the button down to perform a twist.
7. When finished, fuse wires _starting from the point at which they separate_ using the hot air gun at ~480 deg. C.
8. Roll each of the bobbins forward a bit in order to release tension on the tetrode wire.
9. Cut the tetrode wire above the point at which the wires are fused
10. Pull the alligator clip off the magnet and cut the finished tetrode into a storage box.

TODO: Add video for the above steps

## Loading bobbins 

![Loading bobins.](./resources/loading-bobbins/load-bobbin.png)
\FloatBarrier

To load a bobbin, follow these steps:

1. Remove the wire shield by removing its M6-retention screw
2. Remove one set of bobbins by unscrewing the M3 bold that serves as the axle.
3. Take the bobbins and spacers off the axle.
4. Remove any remaining tetrode wire from bobbin and make sure it is clean of dirt and debris.
5. Remove the twisting attachment from the motor.
6. Place a bobbin on the motor using the embedded magnets
7. Adjust the position of the wire guide such that the pointy part points directly into the center of the wire channel on the bobbin.
8. Place the stock spool bearings into the stocks pole and mount on the steel post using the M3 bolt
9. Feed the tetrode wire from the stock spool through the wire guide and wrap once around the bobbin.
10. Set the controller to `mode 1`
11. Select the desired number of turns to load the bobbin. The circumference of the bobbin is ~10 cm. The amount of wire loaded on the bobbin is therefore the number of turns * 10 cm.
12. Start the turn and wait until it is finished.  __Be very careful not touch moving parts during this process__: the TT wire needs to have constant tension to ensure it is properly loaded on the bobbin.
13. Put the bobbins bake on their axle and place back on the bobbin mount.
14. Replace the wire shield.

## Twister Assembly (TODO) 

### Feeder Assembly

![Feeder assembly.](./resources/feeder-assembly/feeder-assembly.png)
\FloatBarrier

1. Insert press-in components into the feeder base. This includes M3 nut (2x),
M3 standoff (2x), and 3/16" diameter dowel pin (2x).
1. Mount the feeder base unto the C1545/M mounting clamp using 2 M6 screws. The
top of the feeder should be flush with the mounting clamp.
1. Cut two 5 cm sections from the M3 threaded rod. Turn each section into the
M3 nut which behind the feeder base.
1. Use the 60 mm M3 screw to mount the bobbin assembly to the standoff captive
within the feeder base. Repeat for both sides.
1. Thread a torsional spring onto the dowel pin. Squeeze between the shallow
groove on the bobbin and the threaded rod. Repeat for each of the 4 bobbins.
1. Mount the bobbin shield over the bobbins using a single M6 screw.

### Rotor Assembly

![TODO: Rotor assembly.](./resources/rotor-assembly/rotor-assembly.png){width=50%}
\FloatBarrier

1. Remove the long, M3 step screws from the bottom of the stepper motor (4x).
1. Put the motor mount under the motor and reinstall long screws, holding the
mount plate to the bottom of the motor
1. Insert two magnets into the spring rotor top _in the same orientation_.
1. Stick two additional magnets to those you just inserted into spring rotor
and then use the spring rotor to press fit these two magnets into the spring
rotor base.
1. Push the spring rotor base, now with captive magnets, onto the stepper motor
shaft.
1. Fix the spring rotor base onto the shaft with the M3 set screw
1. Push the clip magnet into one of the slots on the spring rotor top.

### Wire Guide Assembly

1. Screw the wire-guide into a mini, 6mm-diameter optical post
1. Push the optical post into a swivel post holder.

### Stock Spool Assembly

![Stock spool assembly. TODO: label parts](./resources/stock-spool-assembly/stock-spool-assembly.png){width=40% }
\FloatBarrier

1. Push a bearing into each of the stock spool bearing cases.
1. Push each of the bearing cases into the stock spool of tetrode wire.
1. Push a 60mm, M3 screw through the two bearings and screw into a mini, 6-mm
diameter optical post.
1. Push the optical post into a swivel post holder.

### Twister Assembly

![Twister3 assembly.](./resources/operation/overview-operation.png){width=80%}
\FloatBarrier

1. Screw together the large, 1.5" diameter mounting posts and then screw this
long post into either the left or right side of the optical bread board.
2. Mount the feeder assembly on the post using the post mounting clamp on its
back.
3. Mount the rotor assembly directly in front of the post, as close as it will
go, using 4x M6 screws.
4. Mount the wire guide assembly into a position that is in close proximity to
the rotor assembly using a single M6 screw.
5. Mount the stock spool assembly in on the opposite side of the optical
breadboard using a simple M6 screw.


## Control Box Assembly (TODO)
- Assembly of box starting with pre-fab PCB

## Controller Firmware
The twister3 controller firmware runs on a teensy 3.2. To program the teensy you
will need the following Arduino dependencies:

- [TeensyStep](https://github.com/luni64/TeensyStep)
- [Liquid Crystal](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/LiquidCrystal)
- [Teensyduino add-on](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_download.html)
- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)

The firmware is located
[here](https://github.com/jonnew/twister3/tree/master/firmware/twister3). The
firmware can be uploaded to the device using the [Arduino
IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) in combination with the Cyclops
Arduino library: `./lib/cyclops`. _Note that you will need to add the
[Teensyduino add-on](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/teensyduino.html) to to the
Arduino IDE to program the Teensy_.
